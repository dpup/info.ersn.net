# Feature Specification: Live Data API Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-api`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an API server that can be used by a static website to make client side requests for live data to show in the websites sidebar. The site should therefore have CORS headers and expose a clean, well defined REST interface. The information that will be available from the API server will be fetched by the server and cached in memory.  
 
The first set of information will pull from the Google Routes API. The server will be configured with a number of routes. The info server will then return information about the road conditions on these routes - are the roads open, is their chain control, are there any alerts or warnings, what are the current traffic conditions. 
 
The second set of information are current weather and weather alerts for the area. 
 
There will be no authentication."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A static website makes API requests to retrieve live road conditions and weather information for display in its sidebar. The API server provides current traffic conditions for configured routes, road closures, chain control requirements, and weather alerts that the website can consume and display to visitors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a static website makes an API request, **When** requesting road conditions, **Then** the API returns current conditions for all configured routes within 5 seconds
2. **Given** there are traffic delays on a monitored route, **When** the API is queried for traffic conditions, **Then** current delays and congestion data are returned
3. **Given** there are weather alerts for the area, **When** the API is queried for weather data, **Then** active alerts and current conditions are returned
4. **Given** a route has chain control requirements, **When** the API returns road conditions, **Then** chain control status is included in the response
5. **Given** a road closure exists on a monitored route, **When** the API is queried, **Then** closure information is returned with relevant details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Google Routes API is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system handle weather service outages?
- What is displayed when no traffic data is available for a route?
- How are stale or outdated cached data scenarios handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide current road conditions for all configured routes including open/closed status
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve and display chain control requirements for monitored routes  
- **FR-003**: System MUST show current traffic conditions including delays and congestion levels
- **FR-004**: System MUST display road alerts and warnings for all configured routes
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide current weather conditions for the configured area
- **FR-006**: System MUST display active weather alerts and warnings
- **FR-007**: System MUST cache all retrieved data in memory to improve response times
- **FR-008**: System MUST expose data through a REST API accessible to web browsers
- **FR-009**: System MUST include appropriate CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests from the static website
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses
- **FR-011**: System MUST refresh cached data automatically to ensure information remains current
- **FR-012**: System MUST be accessible without authentication or authorization

### Additional Requirements
- **FR-013**: System MUST refresh cached data every 5 minutes by default, with refresh interval configurable via server configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST monitor routes as specified in server configuration
- **FR-015**: Weather information MUST cover pre-configured locations as specified in server configuration
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle low concurrent usage (single instance sufficient with in-memory caching)
- **FR-017**: Cached data MUST be considered stale after twice the refresh interval (10 minutes by default), with staleness threshold configurable via server configuration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Route**: Represents a monitored road/highway route with attributes for name, current status, traffic conditions, chain requirements, and alerts
- **Traffic Condition**: Current traffic state for a route including congestion level, delays, and incident information
- **Road Alert**: Warnings, closures, or other important notices affecting route conditions
- **Weather Data**: Current weather conditions for the monitored area including temperature, conditions, and visibility
- **Weather Alert**: Active weather warnings, watches, or advisories that may affect travel conditions
- **Cache Entry**: Stored data with timestamp, source, and expiration information for managing data freshness
