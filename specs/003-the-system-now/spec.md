# Feature Specification: Intelligent Caching for OpenAI-Enhanced Caltrans Data

**Feature Branch**: `003-the-system-now`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The system now uses OpenAI to process/clean caltrans data. We want to avoid blocking user requests on OpenAI processing, since it can be slow, while at the same time limiting how often we call out to the API to reduce costs. We therefore need to find a balance of proactively fetching and processing the data, to make sure it's fresh, while also caching. There is already some caching in place, however, we should add another layer of caching. For instance, if we refresh the caltrans feed and get \"incident 123\", which we've already seen, we shouldn't need to send it to open AI again."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
End users of the ERSN Info system need fast, up-to-date road condition information that includes processed/cleaned incident data. The system should provide this information quickly without delays from external AI processing, while maintaining cost efficiency by avoiding redundant AI processing of previously seen incidents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Caltrans incident "Road closure at Mile 15" exists in cache, **When** the same incident appears in a fresh Caltrans feed refresh, **Then** the system uses cached processed data without calling OpenAI
2. **Given** a new incident "Construction at Mile 22" appears, **When** the system encounters this incident for the first time, **Then** the system processes it through OpenAI and caches the result
3. **Given** a user requests road conditions, **When** all required incident data is available in cache, **Then** the response is delivered immediately without waiting for OpenAI processing
4. **Given** cache contains stale processed data, **When** the cache expires, **Then** the system proactively refreshes the data in the background

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OpenAI processing fails but cached data exists?
- What occurs when identical incidents have slight variations in raw text?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST avoid redundant OpenAI processing of previously encountered Caltrans incidents
- **FR-002**: System MUST serve user requests immediately using cached processed data when available
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify when incident data is functionally identical to prevent duplicate processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST proactively refresh processed incident data in background to maintain freshness
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain cost efficiency by minimizing OpenAI API calls while ensuring data quality
- **FR-006**: System MUST serve stale cached data if OpenAI processing is unavailable, with appropriate indicators
- **FR-007**: System MUST expire cached processed data one hour after the incident is no longer present in Caltrans feeds
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain processed incident cache without storage limit concerns for typical operational volumes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Incident Cache Entry**: Represents a processed Caltrans incident with original raw data, processed content, processing timestamp, and expiration status
- **Incident Identifier**: Unique representation of incident content that allows detection of duplicate incidents across feed refreshes
- **Cache Manager**: Coordinates storage, retrieval, and lifecycle management of processed incident data
