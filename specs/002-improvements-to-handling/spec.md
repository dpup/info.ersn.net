# Feature Specification: Smart Route-Relevant Alert Filtering

**Feature Branch**: `002-improvements-to-handling`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Improvements to handling of caltrans KML feeds. Currently the system is pulling in alerts that are not relavent as we are primarily concerned with issues affecting predefined routes. For example, we want to know about lane closures on Highway 4 between Angels Camp and Murphys, but not other roads in and around murphys. The other issue is that the descriptions are not very user friendly. For incidents, it would be helpful to show more than just those actually on hwy4, but we should differentiate between \"on-route\" and \"nearby\" incidents."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: route-specific filtering, alert relevance, user-friendly descriptions, on-route vs nearby classification
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified for travelers checking road conditions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (route segments, alerts, locations)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A traveler planning to drive Highway 4 from Angels Camp to Murphys wants to quickly understand if there are any road issues that will affect their specific route. They need to distinguish between problems directly on their path versus incidents in the general area that won't impact their journey.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user checks Highway 4 Angels Camp to Murphys route, **When** there is a lane closure directly on Highway 4 between those points, **Then** the alert appears as "On Route" with clear, readable description
2. **Given** a user checks Highway 4 Angels Camp to Murphys route, **When** there is an incident on a side street in Murphys, **Then** the alert appears as "Nearby" (if shown at all) with clear indication it doesn't affect the main route
3. **Given** a user checks Highway 4 Angels Camp to Murphys route, **When** there are incidents 50 miles away from the route, **Then** those alerts do not appear in the results
4. **Given** a user sees an alert, **When** they read the description, **Then** they can quickly understand what's happening without technical jargon or cryptic codes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an incident is exactly at a route endpoint (Angels Camp or Murphys)?
- How does system handle incidents that affect access roads to the main route?
- What if an incident spans multiple route segments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST filter alerts to show only those relevant to specific monitored routes
- **FR-002**: System MUST classify alerts as either "On Route" (directly affecting the route path) or "Nearby" (in surrounding area but not blocking route)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide human-readable alert descriptions instead of raw technical messages
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to distinguish between incidents that will impact their travel versus those that won't
- **FR-005**: System MUST prioritize on-route incidents over nearby ones in alert presentation
- **FR-006**: System MUST exclude alerts that are more than 10 miles from monitored routes (distance threshold should be configurable)
- **FR-007**: Alert descriptions MUST be understandable to general public without domain expertise
- **FR-008**: System MUST show incidents that affect multiple route segments in the alert responses for all affected routes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Route Segment**: A specific section of road with defined start and end points (e.g., "Highway 4 from Angels Camp to Murphys")
- **Alert Classification**: Category indicating relationship to route ("On Route", "Nearby", "Distant/Filtered")
- **Readable Description**: User-friendly version of incident information with location, impact, and expected duration
- **Geographic Relevance**: Spatial relationship between incident location and monitored route path
